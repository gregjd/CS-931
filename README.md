CS-931
======

Here is the Python code from two course projects I did for [CS 931](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs0931/2013/index.shtml) at Brown University. It's back from when I was first learning to code, so there are plenty of things I would do differently if I were doing them today. That said, I like having these around as reminders of an earlier era.

The two projects were:

* [Subway Showdown: Comparing Local and Express Train Times in NYC](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/subway/)

* [The Rise of Senior Staff Writers](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/ssw/)
